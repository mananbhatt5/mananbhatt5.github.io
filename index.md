# Welcome To Manan Bhatt's Personal Website!
UMD '23 - Computer and Data Science Student
## Building Software With A Purpose.
## My Story
Technology has driven my life for as long as I can remember. Upon discovering Microsoft Excel at age 9, I would often grab random statistics off the internet and make different graphs based on the stats. Unknowingly, this marked the start of my passion for Technology, Statistics, and most importantly, Data Science.

When I was having my existential crisis in High School trying to decide what I wanted to do when I got older (as all High Schoolers do), my Dad who works in IT, and my Mom who knows my strengths better than anyone, encouraged me to take a few classes in Computer Programming. In my Junior Year of High School, I took APCSA as well as AP Stats, in which I solidified that I wanted to bridge between CS and Statistics for the rest of my life. 

Upon my admission into UMD, I saw their Data Science track and was sold. I dove deeper into the coursework and realized I can do exactly that - bridge CS and Stats. I got heavily involved in an organization on campus called TAMID, in which I can do Data Science consulting for Startups in Israel. I also worked hard in all my classes, and recieved ML based internships in my first two years of college.

Currently, I teach Data Science with Python as the Director of Tech at TAMID. I also have full-stack experience with Python and Flask, and DB experience with Mongo, SQL, and Firebase. I can also code in Java, C, R, and MATLAB. Being the young man from Jersey I am, I hope to one day work as a Data Scientist or Software Engineer in New York City, either at a bank or a startup, and I'll do whatever it takes for my dreams to come true.

This website is basically my digital resume, where I showcase all of my projects, and just allow people to know more about me. I am a very open person, so for those curious about me, feel free to browse through this website, so you can learn more about me!

## More About Me
Another one of my defining characteristics is my love for music. My favorite artists include Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar, Tyler The Creator, Frank Ocean, Freddie Gibbs, Jay-Z, Nas, ATCQ, and many more. I also am very outgoing, as my friends will all say. I enjoy dancing, singing, playing and watching Football (go Giants!) and Basketball (go Knicks!), and just having a good time!

## My Projects
My coursework and extracurricular activities have led to me creating some pretty awesome projects!
1. **Man, I Love Football!**: For the Final in my Data Science class, I worked with two of my close friends and classmates to pull data from the 2021 NFL Season to create a ML Model which simulates NFL games and predicts their scores! You can find that [here](https://mananbhatt-cmsc320.github.io/).
2. **ChatBot**: (IN PROGRESS) Built an automated ChatBot which responds to user input on a GUI. You can find that [here](https://github.com/mananbhatt5/ChatBot).
3. **Resume Parsing Machine**: For my Machine Learning Internship at NYC/Tel Aviv based startup excelHERate, I created a Resume Parsing Machine, which takes resumes in .docx format and generates a file containing Name, Email, Skills, and Graduation Year. You can find that [here](https://github.com/mananbhatt5/excelHERate).
4. **Sentiment Analysis Machine**: For my Machine Learning Internship at Somerset, NJ startup Caresoft, Inc. I built a Sentiment Analysis Machine, which analyzes TripAdvisor reviews of a Jersey City, NJ hotel, and determined how much sentiment each review was written with, as well as each review's magnitude. You can find that [here](https://github.com/mananbhatt5/caresoft-sentiment-analysis-machine-2020).
